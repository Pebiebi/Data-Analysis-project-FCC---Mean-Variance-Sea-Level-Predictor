# Data-Analysis-project-FCC---Mean-Variance-Sea-Level-Predictor

### Description
In this project, historical sea level data from 1880 to the present was analyzed to predict future sea level changes. The analysis includes:
- Creating a scatter plot of the data.
- Calculating and plotting a line of best fit for all available data.
- Calculating and plotting a separate line of best fit using data from the year 2000 onward.
- Predicting sea level rise through the year 2050.

### Key Features
- Data manipulation using **Pandas**.
- Visualization using **Matplotlib**.
- Statistical regression analysis using **SciPy**.

### Files
- `sea_level_predictor.py`: Python script for data analysis and visualization.
- `main.py`: Script to test the implementation.
- `epa-sea-level.csv`: Dataset containing historical sea level data.

### Example Outputs
Below is a description of the generated outputs:
- **Scatter plot**: Displays the relationship between the year and the sea level change.
- **Line of best fit**: Two lines predicting sea level rise:
  - Using the entire dataset (1880–present).
  - Using data from the year 2000 onward.
- **Saved plot**: The resulting plot is saved as `sea_level_rise.png`.
