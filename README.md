# Data-Analysis-project-FCC---Mean-Variance-Sea-Level-Predictor

## Overview
This project analyzes the global average sea level change from 1880 to the present and predicts the sea level rise through the year 2050. The dataset used for this analysis is the "epa-sea-level.csv" file, which contains data on sea level changes. The project uses **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** for visualization, and **SciPy** for statistical analysis and regression modeling.

## Features
- **Scatter plot**: Visualizes the relationship between years and the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level.
- **Line of best fit**: Creates a regression line for the entire dataset, predicting the sea level rise up to the year 2050.
- **Second regression line**: Focuses on data from the year 2000 onward, predicting the sea level rise to 2050 based on more recent trends.
- **Prediction for 2050**: The lines of best fit are extended to 2050 to estimate future sea level rise.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **SciPy**
